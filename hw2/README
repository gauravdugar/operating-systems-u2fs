WEBSITE_REFERENCES
------------------
1. http://lxr.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/linux/source
Referred for linux source code for files like dcache.c, fs.h

2. http://git.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/?p=unionfs-3.2.y.git;a=summary
Referred for UNION_FS source code.
Used to refer many files and functions. Respective comments have been added
with all such files and functions.


INITIAL_SETUP
-------------
1. make kernel using kernel.config provided in:
	/usr/src/hw2-gdugar/
	OR
	/usr/src/hw2-gdugar/hw2/

2. To install module, run from hw2-gdugar folder,
	insmod fs/u2fs/u2fs.ko

3. To mount U2FS, run
	mount -t u2fs -o ldir={LPATH},rdir={RPATH} null {MOUNT_PATH}

	LPATH, RPATH and MOUNT_PATH should pre-exist and should be proper.

4. Now go to MOUNT_PATH and perform any operations as needed.


HACKS
-----
1. Wrapfs code was copied and renamed to u2fs. (including filename, text and all)
2. Respective entries made in magic and super.
3. Then many functions and files were taken and modified from UNIONFS to U2FS code.
4. Many functions were modified to accept extra int argument, 0 implies left and 1 meant right.
5. Inode does not point to noth lower Inodes. It points to only one.
   The other (with less priority) can be accesses using its dentry. 
6. Superblock has left and right pointers.
7. Dentry has left and right path.


FUNCTIONALITY_IMPLEMENTED
-------------------------
******* COPY_UP is NOT implemented, so certain functions does not work in right branch.
	They don't cause kernel crash, they just return appropriate errors.

******* WHITEOUT has been implemented and works perfectly.
	It also does not show the .wh.* files while doing LS

Following functionality are implemented and works:
-> LS
-> FIND (find a file "find . -name {filename}")
-> CAT/LESS (read content of a file, works for both branches)
-> RM (remove a file)
-> RMDIR (remove directory)
-> CP (copy a file)
-> MV (move/rename a file/dir)
-> MKDIR (create new directory)
-> TOUCH (create new file)
-> LN (create hard link, cannot create links of file/dir in right branch)
-> LN -S (create soft link)
-> STAT (check stat of a file/dir)
	shows stat of file from higher priority
	branch (left) if both branches have same.
-> DF
-> CHMOD (change mode works on left, not on right as copyup is required)

and many more...!!


DUPLICATE_ELIMINATION
---------------------
hw2-gdugar/hw2/coreutils/src/ls.c has been modified for duplicate name elimination.
It can be compiled by running "make" in hw2/coreutils.

To use/run this custom ls, run:
	/usr/src/hw2-gdugar/hw2/coreutils/src/ls {OPTIONAL_LOCATION_FOR_LS}


EXTRA_CREDIT_DUPLICATE_ELIMINATION
----------------------------------
1. use kernel.cofig from hw2-gdugar/hw2/ or hw2-gdugar/ directory.
2. add CONFIG_EXTRA_CREDIT = y in config file.
3. make using it and it works. The normal ls will not show the duplicate entries.
4. Its implementation is in hw2-gdugar/fs/u2fs/file.c
